# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Purpose:  Create run_analysis.R to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Usage information:

1. Set your working directory using setwd().
2. Unzip the source https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip into the working directory to create "UCI HAR Dataset" subdirectory.
3. Put run_analysis.R in the working directory and run source("run_analysis.R") to generate tiny_data.txt.
